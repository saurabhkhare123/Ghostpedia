    <h1>Apep, the Enemy of Light</h1>
    <img src="img/31.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Apep or Apophis (Ancient Greek: Άποφις; also spelled Apepi or Aapep) was




        an evil god in ancient Egyptian religion, the deification of darkness and chaos (ı͗zft in Egyptian), and thus
        opponent of light and Ma'at (order/truth), whose existence was believed from the 8th Dynasty (mentioned at
        Moalla) onwards. His name is reconstructed by Egyptologists as *ʻAʼpāpī, as it was written ꜥꜣpp(y) and survived
        in later Coptic as Aphōph.</p>
    <p>As the personification of all that was evil, Apep was seen as a giant snake, crocodile, serpent, or in later
        years, in a few cases, as a dragon, leading to titles such as Serpent from the Nile, and Evil lizard. Some
        elaborations even said that he stretched 16 yards in length and had a head made of flint.</p>
    <img src="img/32.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>Neither Shu, Maahes nor Serqet were strong enough to kill Apep. Only a few could kill him -  boasts that
        "Every day I slay the enemy of Ra when I stand at the helm of the Barque of Millions of Years, which no other
        god dare do." He was the only deity who was strong enough to withstand the power of Apep, and to kill the water
        serpent. The Great Cat of Iunu, Apep and the Sons of Horus

        (Set resumes): "Back, Fiend, from the onslaught of his light! If you speak, your face will be overturned by the
        gods. Your heart will be seized by the lynx (Mafdet), your reins will be bound by the scorpion (Hededet), you
        will be punished by Ma'at, she will bring you to grief."

        ...

        (Apep cries out that he will conform to the divine will): "I will perform your will, O Ra, I will act properly,
        I will act peacefully, O Ra!"

        (Set speaks again): "Bring your ropes, O Ra, that Apep may fall to your snaring or be trapped by the gods of
        north, south, east and west in their traps ... All is now well, O Ra! Proceed in peace! And you, Apep, Down!
        Away, Apep, O Enemy of Ra!"

        (During the fight with Horus, Set loses his testicles ... Apep now taunts Set with this): "But what you felt is
        worse than the sting of the scorpion. What ma'at did to you was so dire that you will suffer from its effect
        forever! You will never go courting, you will never make love!" Set, Defending the Solar Barque Against Apep

        (Stung by this retort, Set determines to destroy Apep rather than just keep him in bondage ...) "Apep, O Enemy
        of Ra! Turn your face away! Ra hates the very sight of you." The head is then cut off, hacked in pieces and
        thrown away on either side of the roads ... "Your head is crushed, O Groundling! Your bones are broken up and
        your flesh cut in pieces. Ra has consigned you to the earth, O Apep! Enemy of Ra!"</p>
