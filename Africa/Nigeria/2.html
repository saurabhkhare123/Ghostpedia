    <h1>Mami Wata</h1>
    <img src="img/22.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Most scholarly sources suggest the name “Mami Wata” is a pidgin English derivation of “Mother Water,” reflecting
        the goddess’s title (“mother of water” or “grandmother of water”) in the Agni language of Cote d’Ivoire,
        although this etymology has been disputed by Africanist writers in favor of various non-English etymologies, for
        example, the suggestion of a linguistic derivation from ancient Egyptian and Mesopotamian, such as the Egyptian
        terms “Mami” or “Mama,” meaning “truth” “Uati” or “Uat-Ur” for “ocean water”. Historical evidence for such a
        deep antiquity of the goddess’s tradition demands a further research to a connection with the Mesopotamian Ea or
        the Syrian Atargaris. Commonly thought to be a single entity, the term Mami Wata has been applied to a number of
        African water deity traditions across various cultures.



        The spiritual importance of Mami Wata is deeply rooted in the ancient tradition and mythology of the coastal
        southeastern Nigerians (Efik, Ibibio and Annang people). Mami Wata often carries expensive baubles such as
        combs, mirrors, and watches. A large snake (symbol of divination and divinity) frequently accompanies her,
        wrapping itself around her and laying its head between her breasts. Other times, she may try to pass as
        completely human, wandering busy markets or patronising bars. She may also manifest in a number of other forms,
        including as a man. Traders in the 20th century carried similar beliefs with them from Senegal to as far as
        Zambia.

        As the Mami Wata traditions continued to re-emerge, native water deities were syncretized into it. Traditions on
        both sides of the Atlantic tell of the spirit abducting her followers or random people whilst they are swimming
        or boating. She brings them to her paradisaical realm, which may be underwater, in the spirit world, or both.
        Should she allow them to leave, the travellers usually return in dry clothing and with a new spiritual
        understanding reflected in their gaze. These returnees often grow wealthier, more attractive, and more easygoing
        after the encounter</p>

    <p>In contrast to her positive nature Mami Wata is blamed for all sorts of misfortune. In Cameroon, for example,
        Mami Wata is ascribed with causing the strong undertow that kills many swimmers each year along the coast. Mami
        Wata’s association with sex and lust is somewhat paradoxically linked to one with fidelity. According to a
        Nigerian tradition, male followers may encounter the spirit in the guise of a beautiful, sexually promiscuous
        woman, such as a prostitute. In Nigerian popular stories, Mami Wata may seduce a favored male devotee and then
        show herself to him following coitus. She then demands his complete sexual faithfulness and secrecy about the
        matter. Acceptance means wealth and fortune; rejection spells the ruin of his family, finances, and job, akin to
        the Melusine-folk lore of medieval France.In Haiti, Lasirenn is a Voodoo loa who represents Mami Wata. She is
        described as a strong-willed, sensual siren who possesses the ability to drown those enticed by her. Lasirenn is
        often depicted as a half-fish, half-human being, but is occasionally portrayed as a whale. Similar to many other
        depictions of Mami Wata, Lasirenn is often shown gazing at herself in a mirror, a symbolic representation of her
        beauty. She is often associated with queer relationships among Black women.</p>
