    <h1>Madam Koin Koin</h1>
  <center> <img src="img/3.jpg" alt="" class="img1"></center> 
    <p>Madam koin Koin is one of the most popular Nigeria urban legends. This legend centers on the death of a teacher
        and how she hunts boarding school. There are a bunch of different versions but I will be sharing with you the
        most common ones. There was once a female teacher who always love dressing up. No matter what she wears, she
        will pair it with red heels every single day. However, her students did not like her because she was really mean
        and never changes her red heel. One day the students decided to hide her heels so she was forced to walk home
        barefooted.

    </p><p>    On her way home, she stepped on a nail which killed her after some days. Before she died she swore that she
        would have her revenge on the school and its students. And you know what? She did keep to her words! Boarding
        school students up till this day have claimed to have heard the sounds of heels walking on their hallway
        “koi-koi-koi” late at night. Some have even claimed to see Madam koi koi; a scary look woman with red eyes
        wearing a gown soaked with blood and her red heels.</p>
