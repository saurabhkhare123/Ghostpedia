    <h1>Screaming skull</h1>

        A screaming skull is a paranormal object, a human skull which per legend speaks, screams, or otherwise haunts
        its environs. The legend is most found in England and other English-speaking regions.

        The Bettiscombe screaming skull of Dorset, England, is attested at least as early as 1897 in the book The
        Haunted Homes and Family Traditions of Great Britain. That book details an alleged visit to Bettiscombe in 1883
        by curiosity-seekers to investigate a skull which, according to legend, was of an African slave once owned by
        the owner of the house. The slave had supposedly died determined to be buried in his homeland, and any attempt
        to bury his skull elsewhere would cause the skull to scream aloud.</p>
