    <h1>Chasse-Galerie</h1>
    <img src="img/chas1.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Chasse-galerie also known as "The Bewitched Canoe" or "The Flying Canoe" is a popular French-Canadian tale of
        Coureurs des bois who make a deal with the devil, a variant of the Wild Hunt. Its best-known version was written
        by Honoré Beaugrand (1848–1906). It was published in The Century Magazine in August 1892.</p>
    <p>
        <img src="img/chas2.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
        The story can be traced back to a French legend about a rich nobleman named Gallery who loved to hunt. He loved
        it so much that he refused to attend Sunday mass. As punishment for this sin he was condemned to fly forever
        through the night skies, chased by galloping horses and howling wolves, in a fashion reminiscent of the Wild
        Hunt stories.

        When French settlers arrived in Canada, they swapped stories with the natives and the tale of Gallery was
        combined with a First Nations legend about a flying canoe. In time bark canoes became associated with
        French-Canadian culture as well; when some of the earliest French-Canadians arrived in New York City, they were
        reported to have landed on the banks of the Hudson River to "the amazement and admiration of the people, who had
        never seen bark canoes in their waters before".
