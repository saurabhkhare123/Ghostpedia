    <h1>Rose Latulippe Legend</h1>
    <img src="img/download.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>The Legend of Rose Latulipe, also known as The Legend of the Devil at the Dance and The Legend of the Beautiful
        Dancer, is a French Canadian legend (Quebecois and Acadian), from the 18th century. There are more than 200
        different versions of the legend. The most well-known version was written by Philippe-Joseph Aubert de Gaspé, in
        1837 in Le chercheur de trésor ou l'influence d'un livre.

        This version recounts the story of Rose Latulipe, a young and frivolous girl who loved to dance. On the night of
        Mardi Gras, a stranger showed up at the Latulipe house and danced with Rose until the stroke of midnight. The
        stranger is revealed to be the Devil. According to some versions, the Devil disappeared, taking Rose with him to
        Hell. According to other versions, the priest of the village intervened, saving her. She would subsequently
        enter a convent and die a few years later.

        The legend is one of many examples in French Canadian folklore of girls 'dancing with the devil.' The stories
        may have served as cautionary tales for young girls about the dangers of dancing with strangers who could be
        criminals, particularly during Lent or on Sundays.</p>
