   <h1>Green Man</h1>

   <p>
    The Green Man, and very occasionally the Green Woman, is a legendary being primarily interpreted as a symbol of rebirth, representing the cycle of new growth that occurs every spring. The Green Man is most commonly depicted in a sculpture, or other representation of a face which is made of, or completely surrounded by, leaves.

    The Green Man motif has many variations. Branches or vines may sprout from the mouth, nostrils, or other parts of the face, and these shoots may bear flowers or fruit. Found in many cultures from many ages around the world, the Green Man is often related to natural vegetation deities. Often used as decorative architectural ornaments, Green Men are frequently found in carvings on both secular and ecclesiastical buildings. "The Green Man" is also a popular name for English public houses, and various interpretations of the name appear on inn signs, which sometimes show a full figure rather than just the face.
    
    Some speculate that the mythology of the Green Man developed independently in the traditions of separate ancient cultures and evolved into the wide variety of examples found throughout history.

    In his A Little Book of The Green Man, as well as his website, Mike Harding gives examples of green man figures from Lebanon and Iraq dated to the 2nd century. Similar figures exist in Borneo, Nepal, and India.

    An early example of a green man disgorging vegetation from his mouth is from St. Abre, in St. Hilaire-le-grand, c. 400 AD.
    
    The tradition of the Green Man being carved on to Christian churches exists across Europe, including examples such as the Seven Green Men of Nicosia carved into the facade of the thirteenth century St Nicholas Church in Cyprus. Harding references a foliate head from an 8th-century Jain temple in Rajasthan.
    
    There are early Romanesque foliate heads in 11th century Templar churches in Jerusalem. Harding tentatively suggests that the symbol may have originated in Asia Minor and been brought to Europe by travelling stone carvers.
    
    From the Renaissance onwards, elaborate variations on the Green Man theme, often with animal heads rather than human faces, appear in many media other than carvings (including manuscripts, metalwork, bookplates, and stained glass). They seem to have been used for purely decorative effect rather than reflecting any deeply held belief. A Swiss engraver, Numa Guyot,[10] created a bookplate depicting a Green Man in exquisite detail. It was completed circa 1887.
    
    In Britain, the image of the Green Man enjoyed a revival in the 19th century, becoming popular with architects during the Gothic revival and the Arts and Crafts era, when it appeared as a decorative motif in and on many buildings, both religious and secular.[citation needed] American architects took up the motif around the same time.[citation needed] The Green Man travelled with the Europeans as they colonized the world.[citation needed] Many variations can be found in Neo-gothic Victorian architecture. He was very popular amongst Australian stonemasons and can be found on many secular and sacred buildings.
