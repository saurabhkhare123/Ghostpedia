    <h1> Homey The Clown</h1>
    <img src="Homey the .webp" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>
        Homey the Clown was originally a beloved character on a television show in the early 1980's, but in the Chicago
        area, Homey brought fear to the children. He was aid to drive around in a white van kidnapping and raping
        children. Some people tracked him down to a Chicago project-area, but he was never caught. He was believed to be
        found by a local gang and killed. Since then, he has been deemed an urban legend, but he has not been forgotten.

    <p>
        Based on a flood of reports from children all over the city, police and school officials are on alert for a new
        bad guy: a man dressed as the TV character ''Homey the Clown'' trying to lure kids into his van with candy and
        money.

        But police are also trying to gauge the reliability of the reports.

        Reports of sightings have come from Oak Park and various parts of Chicago of an African-American male who is
        dressing up as the sock-wielding, child-taunting, militant character made famous by comedian Damon Wayans on
        Fox-TV`s ''In Living Color'' comedy-variety program.

        Oak Park police now dismiss a report by two 10-year-old boys this week that the clown was seen near the Irving
        School, 1125 S. Cuyler Ave. Police Sgt. Robert Dotto said investigating officers and parents believe the report

        ''not to be bona fide.''

        ''I can tell you with reasonable certainty that that does not have merit,'' he said. He said another reported
        sighting also proved unfounded.

        But Chicago police said they are taking several Homey sightings seriously.

        ''If you`re a clown going to work, you`re gonna get stopped,'' warned an officer in the first deputy
        superintendent`s office.

        The reports, mainly from children, have varied. They seem to be reaching near-mythic proportions, tumbling out
        from different parts of the city like clowns falling out of a Volkswagen.

        The evil Homey, described as a 5-foot-11-inch male weighing 175 pounds, reportedly has been seen driving either
        a red, white or blue van with the words ''Ha-Ha'' written on its side. Then again, based on the reports, he also
        could be driving a black pickup truck, a dark-colored Oldsmobile or a brown van.

        From the number of alleged sightings coming from practically all over Chicago, police are theorizing there may
        be one or more phony Homeys roaming the streets.

        Even with Oak Park police shouting one of Homey`s famous catch-phrases,

        ''I don`t think so,'' school officials and parents still must deal with the children`s fears.

        Oak Park Elementary School District 97 issued a letter to parents Thursday alerting them to the rumors of
        Homey-sightings.

        ''We want to take every precaution, but at the same time we don`t want to unnecessarily panic people,'' said
        Sharon Adelman Reyes, principal of Longfellow Elementary School in Oak Park.

        She added, ''I think it`s a rumor that is getting out of hand.''

        In Chicago, in the wake of a Homey sighting at Lemoyne School, 851 W. Waveland Ave., faculty members Thursday
        were stepping up patrols of school grounds.

        The grandmother of one Lemoyne boy said he told her a few days ago,

        ''Grandma, I saw the clown when he crossed the street.''

        The grandmother, who didn`t want her name or her grandson`s name used, said the 10-year-old claimed he saw
        someone dressed as a clown while the boy was looking out the library window.

        Casper Hearon, an 8th grader from nearby Nettelhorst School, said many children are scared to walk alone after
        dark.

        ''I heard there`s not just one, that there`s 10 of `em,'' he said.

        Sherman G. Chambers, assistant principal of Reavis School, 834 E. 50th St., said that early last week, one
        8th-grade student claimed to have seen his sister being confronted by a man wearing a red wig, clown`s nose, a
        red and yellow clown suit and red shoes.

        According to the boy, he pushed the clown and punched him in the nose, Chambers said. The clown then fled.

        ''I kind of believe it had to be true,'' Chambers said. ''This is a big 8th grader who told me this.''
