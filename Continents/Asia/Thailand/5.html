    <h1>Krahang</h1>
    <img src="img/51.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Krahang (Thai: กระหัง, pronounced [krā.hǎŋ]; or กระหาง, [krā.hǎːŋ]) is a male spirit of the Thai folklore. It
        manifests itself as a shirtless man, wearing a traditional loincloth, who flies in the night.

        Krahang uses two large kradong (กระด้ง), round rice winnowing baskets, to fly in the night in rural areas of
        Thailand. It also often rides a sak tam khao (สากตำข้าว), the long wooden pestle of a traditional manual rice
        pounder.
        Krahang is a type of nocturnal ghost that is said to haunt the same areas as Krasue, a female spirit of the Thai
        village folklore, thus these two spirits are often mentioned or represented together. Legends of the Thai
        oral tradition say that this is an evil spirit that may harm people walking at night in out of the way areas.
        Like Krasue it lives the life of a normal villager during the day.</p>
    <img src="img/52.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>But from the research in "Three Seals Law" (กฎหมายตราสามดวง) from Ayutthaya period. Rongroj Piromanukul, an
        anthropologist of Ramkhamhaeng University found that the Krahang don't appear in the list of ghosts, so they
        believe that the names are recorded later.

        In August 2012 villagers at Lat Bua Khao, Sikhio District, in the western part of Nakhon Ratchasima Province,
        blamed Krahang for some nightly attacks on local women.[9] [10]But finally caught up. As a matter of fact, it is
        only a man who is drug addicted.[11]

        In July 2017, an 18-year-old girl at Nong Plong, Chamni District, Buriram Province, claimed that while she was
        in the restroom within her house at night before going to bed, she saw a Krahang through a gap near the ceiling.
        It appeared as a large man with a winged back. The girl panicked and ran out of the restroom, and when this
        story spread as a result, the villagers of the two villages were terrified.One elder villager said she saw
        the krahang for ten years. It flies in pairs with glowing eyes like a thunderbolt, she said she saw it last
        Sunday at the beginning of the year at 02:00 am for a half hour. The woman reportedly tried to get her son to
        film the creature with his cell phone without success.

        The village elder blamed a nearby house in which her family had previously lived, but is now abandoned. In 2010,
        her old sister and her mother died in this house. She then saw strange lights floating out of the house at night
        - she believed these to be Krasue and Krahang. She claimed to be fighting it in her dream for more than ten
        years before she actually saw it in early 2012. The elder hired a sorcerer to hold exorcisms at this house,
        spending over a hundred thousand baht without success.

        Modern adaptations
        Krahang is a popular folk spirit that has been featured in the 1991 Thai film Kahang (กะหัง) and film
        Krahang (กระหัง), and was adapted as a funny character in Thep Sarm Rudoo (เทพสามฤดู) a folk-style
        television series that was made in 1987, 2003 and 2017, as well as in a Sylvania light bulb commercial for
        Thai audiences.</p>
