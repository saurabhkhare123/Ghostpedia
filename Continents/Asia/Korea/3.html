    <h1>Gwisin</h1>
    <img src="img/31.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Gwisin (Korean: 귀신) are a type of spirit or ghost in Korean folklore. They are considered similar to a Yogoe
        (Korean: 요괴);, and Mamul (Korean: 마물); they are people who have died, not monsters or creatures such as
        Dokkaebi.

        These spirits may be found in many places, but most commonly in abandoned buildings, houses, cemeteries,
        forests, and schools. When a person dies without completing something that they must do (e.g. revenge or staying
        longer with their family), their spirit remains on earth to complete the task before going on to the
        underworld. However, very strong gwisin do not go to the underground world if they want to remain on earth,
        and over time these gain strength.</p>
    <img src="img/32.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>There are a lot of legends about Gwisin. Because they are a common form of ghost, children often make them up to
        scare others or parents tell stories to their children to teach them a lesson. Most legends are about
        revenge, revenge for their families or about men who cheated on their wives, or murdered the victim.

        Appearances of Gwisin often occur in high schools, a concept popularized with the release of Whispering
        Corridors, a Korean horror movie released in 1998.</p>
    <p>Gwisin are usually transparent, legless and float in mid-air.[1] Female Gwisin usually have white Hanbok (한복)
        which are worn for funerals.They have long, drooping black hair and sometimes they are faceless, depending on
        their personality. Male Gwisin are somewhat rare, and may appear different.Gwisin have their own reasons to be
        on earth, usually that they have unfinished business. Depending on their personality and attitude, their
        strength and maliciousness can vary. For example, a very calm person who's always nice may not harm or bother
        other people. She/he will stick to her/his reason. A very aggressive ghost can harm people, even by accident. To
        become a Gwisin, they must have a very strong urge to stay, or they will have to go to the underground world.
