    <h1>Kumiho</h1>
    <img src="img/41.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>A kumiho (gumiho) (Korean pronunciation: [kumiho]; Korean: 구미호; Hanja: 九尾狐, literally "nine-tailed fox") is a
        creature that appears in the tales and legends of Korea.Deriving from ancient Chinese myths and folklores, a fox
        that lives a thousand years turns into a kumiho, like its Japanese and Chinese counterparts. It can freely
        transform, among other things, into a beautiful woman often set out to seduce boys, and eat their liver or heart
        (depending on the legend). There are numerous tales in which the kumiho appears, several of which can be found
        in the encyclopedic Compendium of Korean Oral Literature (한국 구비문학 대계/韓國口碑文學大系).Originating in Chinese myths
        dating back centuries before being introduced to Korean mythology,[4] the Korean kumiho shares many similarities
        to the Chinese huli jing and the Japanese kitsune. Classic of Mountains and Seas, an old Chinese text, claims a
        fox with nine tails lives in an area called Qingqiu (靑丘). As the kumiho and other versions of the nine-tailed
        fox myths and folklores originated from China, they all have a similar concept. All explain fox spirits as being
        the result of great longevity or the accumulation of energy, said to be foxes who have lived for a thousand
        years, and give them the power of shapeshifting, usually appearing in the guise of a woman. However, while huli
        jing and kitsune are often depicted with ambiguous moral compasses, possibly good or bad, the kumiho is almost
        always treated as a malignant figure who feasts on human flesh. It is unclear at which point in time Koreans
        began viewing the kumiho as a purely evil creature, since many ancient texts of the Chinese mention the
        benevolent kumiho assisting humans (and even make mentions of wicked humans tricking kind but naïve kumiho). In
        later literature, kumiho were often depicted as bloodthirsty half-fox, half-human creatures that wandered
        cemeteries at night, digging human hearts out from graves. The fairy tale The Fox Sister depicts a fox spirit
        preying on a family for their livers. However, according to Gyuwon Sahwa, kumiho is described as an auspicious
        fox spirit with a book in its mouth. Considering the text is thought to be written in 1675, some speculate that
        the modern violent image of kumiho is influenced during the Japanese occupation in Korea. Nevertheless, foxes
        often contained a negative image during the Koryo Dynasty (Shin Don was described as an old fox spirit due to
        his love for women and drinks despite his being a buddhist monk), suggesting two different views could have
        co-existed in ancient Korea. Taiping Guangji claims Silla worshipped foxes as sacred beings.</p>
    <img src="img/42.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>The most distinctive feature that separates the kumiho from its two counterparts (Japanese kitsune, and Chinese
        huli jing) is the existence of a 'yeowoo guseul' (여우구슬, literally meaning fox marble/bead) which is said to
        consist of knowledge. According to Korean mythology, the yeowoo guseul provides power to the kumiho and
        knowledge (and intelligence) to people if they can steal and swallow one. The kumiho can absorb humans' energy
        with it. The method of absorbing energy with the "yeowoo guseul" resembles a "deep kiss" (i.e. a kiss using a
        tongue). The kumiho sends the yeowoo guseul into people's mouths and then retakes it with their tongues. If that
        person swallows the yeowoo guseul, however, and then observes "sky, land, and people", each observation gives
        the observer preternatural knowledge. But the person fails to watch the "sky" in most tales, so they get a
        special ability but not the most important one.

        Most legends state that while a gumiho was capable of changing its appearance, there is still something
        persistently foxy about it (i.e. a foxy face, a set of ears, or the tell-tale nine tails) or a magical way of
        forcing; its countenance changes, but its nature does not. In Transformation of the Kumiho (구미호의 변신), a kumiho
        transforms into the identical likeness of a bride at a wedding and is only discovered when her clothes are
        removed. Bakh Mun-su and the Kumiho (박문수와 구미호) records an encounter that Pak Munsu has with a girl, living alone
        in the woods, that has a foxy appearance. In The Maiden who Discovered a Kumiho through a Chinese Poem (한시로 구미호를
        알아낸 처녀), the kumiho is ultimately revealed when a hunting dog catches the scent of a fox and attacks. Although
        they have the ability to change forms, the true identity of a kumiho was said to be zealously guarded by the
        kumiho themselves. Some tales say that if a kumiho abstains from killing and eating humans for a thousand days,
        it can become human.

        Much like changelings, werewolves or vampires in Western lore, there are always variations on the myth depending
        on the liberties that each story takes with the legend. One version of the mythology, however, holds that with
        enough will, a kumiho could further ascend from its yogoe (yokai) state, become permanently human and lose its
        evil character. Explanations of how this could be achieved vary, but sometimes include aspects such as
        refraining from killing or tasting meat for a thousand days, or obtaining a cintamani and making sure that the
        Yeoiju saw the full moon at least every month during the ordeal. Unlike Yeoiju-wielding dragons, kumiho were not
        thought to be capable of omnipotence or creation at will, since they were lesser creatures.</p>
