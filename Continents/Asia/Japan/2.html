    <h1>Noh Mask</h1>
    <img src="img/21.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Commonly used as an accessory in dramatic Noh performances, Noh masks have an unsettling appearance of scorn and
        malicious desire. Top-end Noh masks have a variety of expressions which change depending on the lighting and
        direction of the viewer.
        Used as a means to hide motives, Noh masks are said to absorb negative energy and impure thoughts. Houses of
        wealth and high status are known to decorate entrance-ways or shrine rooms with Noh masks in order to prevent
        evil spirits.
        Either as a precaution to deter children from wearing the expensive accessory or to not dirty the design, there
        is a warning which states the Noh mask must not be worn unless on special occasions by a professional.
        Because the Noh mask has the duty of absorbing negative energy and thoughts, it is believed to take on an entity
        of its own - an evil spirit which grows hungry for human souls. If someone were to carelessly wear a Noh mask,
        the soul is sucked from the body; causing the flesh to rot until only a festering corpse remains.
        â€‹The age and power of the Noh mask is said to determine how quickly a wearer's soul is taken. </p>
    <p>A resident of a north-east prefecture explained an experience from his youth about a festival and a Noh mask.
        Being 17 years old at the time, he didn't want to go to the festival out of laziness, but was urged to
        participate by the townsfolk.
        Upon arrival at the festival, there was a large fire circled by all of the people of the town.</p>
    <img src="img/22.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>A banging of drums rang out, and a person wearing a Noh mask appeared from the temple.
        The Noh mask person began to dance and chant, and the townsfolk copied. However, after several minutes, the
        dance turned into a frenzy of trembling limbs; almost like an uncontrollable seizure as people danced without
        thought.
        The young resident, despite his concerns of not wishing to attend the festival, joined the mass of dancing as if
        his limbs were being manipulated.
        After thirty minutes, the drumming and dancing abruptly stopped, to which the townsfolk separated.
        The festival spokesperson invited all of the townsfolk to a meeting after the dancing, however only a small
        percentage of the festival-goers joined.
        The young resident joined the meeting at the request of his friend, and they were both confused at why they had
        been caught up in dancing - unnerved as to how they couldn't recall joining or partaking in the series of
        movements.
        After inquiring about their concerns to a trusted uncle, the elder man replied, "You're right - the Noh mask
        happened. No matter where it is, this sort of thing happens. However, it's good you don't understand the
        situation. A word of warning: when there is this type of festival, participate without hesitation. I'll tell you
        why when you're older."
        Nothing more was ever said.
        To this day, the teller of the story believes it was a festival for the Noh mask to feed on the negative
        emotions of the townsfolk - morphing them into zombie-like creatures which it can easily manipulate until locked
        back into the temple for another year. </p>
