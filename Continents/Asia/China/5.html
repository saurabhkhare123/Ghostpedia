    <h1>Mongolian Death Worm</h1>
    <center><img src="img/5.jpg" alt="" class="img1"></center>
    <p>Rumored to exist in the rocky and unforgiving Gobi Desert, the Mongolian death worm is unquestionably one of
        China’s stranger cryptids. (Unfamiliar with cryptids? Click here.)

        This particular creature is allegedly red in color, somewhere between two and five feet long and as thick as a
        man’s arm. It should be noted that two to five feet is the most commonly stated length, some sources suggest the
        animal can grow to much greater sizes, specifically a short Animal Planet documentary that claims the death worm
        can reach lengths of up to 10 feet.

        Sometimes referred to as the ‘intestine worm’ because of its ridged intestine-like appearance, this cryptid is
        greatly feared by locals due to its highly toxic (or possibly acid-like) venom.

        According to local beliefs, the death worm has the ability to spray its venom from a reasonable distance and the
        substance is powerful enough to kill a camel or horse. Some tales assert the worm can also use electricity on
        hapless passersby. This isn't your standard earthworm folks!</p>

    <p>According to Czech cryptozoologist Ivan Mackerle, in his 1987 book Altajn Tsaadakh Govd, “It [the Mongolian death
        worm] travels underground. Its movement can be detected from above via the waves of sand that it
        displaces.

        While most observers conclude that the death worm is simply a beast of legend (including Markerle, who mounted
        three separate expeditions in 1990, 1992 and 2004), others have suggested it may be an undiscovered species
        sand-dwelling snake. This suggestion is plausible, as snakes do come in various shades of red and some species
        do have the ability to spit venom up to 2 meters.

        Regardless of the likelihood of its existence, the Mongolian death worm has found considerable attention
        worldwide, in books, television shows and a 2010 film titled Mongolian Death Worm (we haven't seen it, but word
        on the street is it's crap).

        So, is a terrifying species of worm lurking beneath the sands of the Gobi Desert? Probably not, but who knows...
