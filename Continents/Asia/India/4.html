    <h1>Yakshi</h1>
    <img src="img/41.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>The three sites of Bharhut, Sanchi, and Mathura, have yielded huge numbers of Yakshi figures, most commonly on
        the railing pillars of stupas. These show a clear development and progression that establishes certain
        characteristics of the Yakshi figure such as her nudity, smiling face and evident (often exaggerated) feminine
        charms that lead to their association with fertility. The yakshi is usually shown with her hand touching a tree
        branch, in a sinuous tribhanga pose, thus some authors hold that the young girl at the foot of the tree is based
        on an ancient tree deity.

        Yakshis were important in early Buddhist monuments as a decorative element and are found in many ancient
        Buddhist archaeological sites. They became Salabhanjikas (sal tree maidens) with the passing of the centuries, a
        standard decorative element of both Indian sculpture and Indian temple architecture.

        The sal tree (Shorea robusta) is often confused with the ashoka tree (Saraca indica) in the ancient literature
        of the Indian Subcontinent. The position of the Salabhanjika is also related to the position of Queen Māyā of
        Sakya when she gave birth to Gautama Buddha under an asoka tree in a garden in Lumbini, while grasping its
        branch</p>
