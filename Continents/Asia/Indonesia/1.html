    <h1>Pocong</h1>
    <img src="img/11.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>The Pocong urban legend, a Pocong, otherwise called wrapped ghost, is an Indonesian/Singaporean ghost that is
        said to be the spirit of a dead individual trapped in its cover. Known in Indonesia/Malaysia as kain kafan, the
        cover is the recommended length of material utilized in Muslim burials to wrap the body of the dead individual.
        The dead body is covered in a white piece of cloth and tied over the head, under the feet, and on the neck. The
        Pocong’s face is light green, shriveled and rotting. There are two dull, empty gaps where its eyes ought to be.
        It is typically found in villages, meandering as the night progressed, jumping up and down as though in search
        of something or someone. The Hantu Pocong’s jump can extend up to 40 or 50 meters. It has also been referred to
        move along the ground too. They can also roll along the ground as well.</p>
    <img src="img/12.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>According to traditional believes, the expired individual’s spirit remains on earth for 40 days after they are
        dead. Following 40 days have passed, the binds must be released to let the spirit get away. In the event that
        the ties aren’t released, the dead body will transform into a ghost and hop out of the grave, turning into a
        pocong. Since the feet are tied together with the white cover, the pocong can’t walk and jumps along the street.

        If you ever come across a pocong, it won’t hurt you, however, it will follow you wherever you go. It will only
        attack somebody if he/she obstructs its way. So, if you ever stumble across a pocong, don’t remain in its
        direction or you’ll regret your decision. There are just two different ways to escape from the pocong. You can
        lie on the ground and profess to be dead or you can attempt and avoid it by running down a long, twisting street
        until it loses sight of you. Just when the knots over the head are untied, the ghost quit chasing you.</p>
