    <h1>Impundulu</h1>
    <img src="img/21.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>The Lightning bird or impundulu is a vampiric bird from southern African myth.</p>
    <p>Frequently described as the hammerkop, the impundulu is a human-sized bird with black and white plumage. It has
        the ability to manifest itself as lightning. In some accounts it takes the form of a rooster, but in others it
        has peacock feathers, or even a red tail, beak, and legs. It has the ability to turn into a beautiful man to
        seduce others.</p>
    <p>It is most infamous for its thirst for blood and pain, which it is known to take from humans, birds, and cattle.
        If its attacks did not kill, it would leave its victims with infertility and tuberculosis. It has the ability to
        bring rain, bad luck, and cause people to have sex.</p>
    <img src="img/22.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>It may abduct children or steal milk from households. The flap of its wings is the source of thunder, and it can
        shoot lightning from its talons. Occasionally it will strike the earth as lightning, and it will lay its egg
        where it lands. It can be caught either by catching it at the moment it strikes or finding it in an underground
        cavern where it hit the ground. The easiest way to find it or its eggs is to search for fairy rings, which
        indicate the place it struck.

        Impundulu are frequently the familiars of witches, and are passed down from mother to daughter as they are
        immortal. However, should a witch fail to pass hers down, the bird will become an ishologu, a masterless force
        of chaos and destruction. While it is a familiar, it can be sent to wreak havoc on the witch's enemies. However,
        if not kept fed, it would ensure the witch's death. In some accounts, the impundulu and the witch become lovers.
        It is often seen riding on the back of a hyena, which witches are known to shapeshift into.

        The impundulu's body and eggs have many magical properties. While often eggs are destroyed, they can also be
        used (along with glowing fish and other ingredients) to create a potion that causes lightning to strike an
        enemy. Its fat could be used in medicinal remedies. Furthermore, its flesh could be used to discover thieves.
        However, it could be difficult to get these ingredients, as its only known weakness is fire; it is impervious to
        all other attacks.</p>
