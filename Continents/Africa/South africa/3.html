    <h1>The white Man and Snake</h1>
   <center><img src="img/3.jpg" alt="" class="img1"></center> 
    <p>A WHITE MAN, it is said, met Snake upon whom a large stone had fallen and covered her so that she could not rise.
        The White Man lifted the stone off Snake, but when he had done so, she wanted to bite him. The White Man said, "
        Stop! let us both go first to some wise people." They went to Hyena, and the White Man asked him, "Is it right
        that Snake should want to bite me, when I helped her as she lay under a stone and could not rise?"

        Hyena (who thought he would get his share of the White Man's body) said, "If you were bitten what would it
        matter?"

        Then Snake wanted to bite him, but the White Man said again, "Wait a little, and let us go to other wise people,
        that I may hear whether this is right."

        They went and met Jackal. The White Man said to Jackal, "Is it right for Snake to want to bite me, when I lifted
        up the stone which lay upon her?"

        Jackal replied, "I do not believe that Snake could be covered by a stone so she could not rise. Unless I saw it
        with my two eyes, I would not believe it. Therefore, come let us go and see the place where you say it happened
        whether it can be true."

        They went, and arrived at the place where it had happened. Jackal said, "Snake, lie down, and let thyself be
        covered."

        Snake did so, and the White Man covered her with the stone; but although she exerted herself very much, she
        could not rise. Then the White Man wanted again to release Snake, but Jackal interfered, and said, "Do not lift
        the stone. She wanted to bite you, therefore she may rise by herself."

        Then they both went away and left Snake under the stone.</p>
