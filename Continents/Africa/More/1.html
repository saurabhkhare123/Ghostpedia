    <h1>Nyami Nyami</h1>
    <img src="img/11.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Since time immemorial, stories of a large creature with the head of a snake and the body of a fish lurking in the
        waters of the Zambezi River have been told. For the Tonga, this creature that has captured the imagination of
        people all over the world is nothing less than a Deity and to date its immensity in stature is cowered towards.
        This river spirit is affectionately known as Nyami Nyami a colonial corruption of Nyama yamaninga ninga which
        means pieces of meat, it is believed that during times of famine Nyami Nyami would expose his belly and the
        Tonga people would cut pieces of meat of his belly.
        Several stories have been told concerning the Nyami Nyami but what is unanimously illustrated in these stories
        is the enormous size of this spirit. It is believed that the creature is no less than three metres wide and
        noone knows his length.
        To date the Tonga people are bitter, they blame the construction of the Kariba dam for removing them from their
        ancestral land and angering their river god, Nyami Nyami. It is believed that Nyami Nyami got separated from his
        wife as a result of the construction of the Kariba dam wall.</p>
    <p>The Tonga people lived in the Gwemebe Valley along the Zambezi for centuries in peaceful seclusion before the
        European colonialists came and disrupted their way of life. The Tonga were protected by Nyami Nyami, their
        Mudzimu (ancestral spirit) who fed them from his own flesh in times of famine. During famines Nyami Nyami would
        expose his belly and the Tonga would cut meat of his belly. The people pledged their allegiance to him by
        performing rituals and ceremonial dances. Every time the people summoned him he always appeared.
        Legend has it that Nyami Nyami and his wife stayed in the Zambezi River near Kariwa gorge, (Kariwa means trap
        and Kariba is a colonial corruption of Kariwa) where the present day Kariba dam wall is situated. One season
        when Nyami Nyami’s wife had gone downstream of the mighty Kariwa Gorge to other people of the Valley to answer
        their prayers and bless her people, the white men came to build a wall thus separating Nyami Nyami and his wife.
        The Tonga’s way of life in the valley came to an end, they were told to leave their homes and move away from the
        valley to avoid the flood that the dam would cause. Reluctantly they allowed themselves to be resettled higher
        up the bank, but they believed Nyami Nyami would never allow the dam to be built and eventually, when the
        project failed, they would move back to their homes.</p>
    <img src="img/12.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>In 1957, when the dam was well on its way to completion, Nyami Nyami struck. The worst floods ever known on the
        Zambezi washed away much of the partly built dam and the heavy equipment, killing many of the workers.
        Some of those killed were Italian dam builders whose bodies disappeared mysteriously, and after an extensive
        search failed to find them, Tonga elders were asked to assist as they knew the river better than anyone. The
        elders explained Nyami Nyami had caused the disaster and in order to appease his wrath a sacrifice should be
        made.
        The Europeans mocked the Nyami Nyami story and did not take the Tonga elders seriously, but, in desperation,
        when relatives of the missing workers were due to arrive to claim the bodies of their loved ones, the search
        party agreed in the hope that the Tonga would know where the bodies were likely to have been washed to.
        A white calf was slaughtered in accordance with tradition and floated on the river. The next morning the calf
        was gone and the workers’ bodies were in its place. The disappearance of the calf holds no mystery in the
        crocodile infested river, but the reappearance of the workers’ bodies three days after they had disappeared has
        never been satisfactorily explained.
        According to Narcissus Nhemachena one of the construction workers present during construction of the dam wall,
        “It took five long years for the dam to be constructed because proper rituals had not been performed to ask for
        permission from Nyami Nyami to construct the dam. Cows were sacrificed and sack loads of money were thrown into
        the river to appease the Nyami Nyami. He caused some floods and loss of life, but at last he was kind enough to
        let the dam wall to be completed. It was the work of the Tonga elders and their spirit mediums to persuade the
        Nyami Nyami to allow the Zambezi to be tamed.”</p>
