    <h1>Adu Ogyinae</h1>
  <center><img src="img/5.jpg" alt="" class="img1"></center>  
    <p>Adu Ogyinae In African mythology (Ashanti of Ghana), the first man. The Ashanti tell several myths concerning the
        origin of man. One states that on Monday night the first man, Adu Ogyinae, came to the surface of the earth
        through holes bored in the ground by a worm. Adu Ogyinae was the leader of a small group of seven men and a few
        women, as well as a leopard and a dog. Of the entire group, only Adu Ogyinae was not frightened by the new
        things he saw on the surface of the earth. By Tuesday he managed to calm the others, but they did not begin to
        build homes until Wednesday.

        Adu was killed when a tree fell on him. Then the dog was sent in search of fire. Meat was cooked with the flame
        he brought back and was fed to him to test whether it was safe. When the dog showed no signs of illness, all of
        the others began to eat. The god of creation then came upon one of the members of the group and made him his
        assistant. Each year the Ashanti hold ceremonies in the woods to commemorate the first human beings.</p>
