    <p>A Fiery Serpent (also known as a snake-Lubac, Letun, Letuchy, Litavets, Maniac, nalyot, ognyanny and prelestnik)
        (Russian: Огненный змей) is an evil entity common to Slavic mythology, which presents itself as an
        anthropomorphic snake demon.</p>
    <p>The Fiery Serpent generally resembles a glowing, fiery rocket, a flaming broom, or a ball of blue fire. According
        to the mythology, it is an evil spirit that reveals itself at night. The serpent has been portrayed as a spirit
        that presents itself as the form of a lost love to widows or women grieving the loss of a lover. In their grief,
        and their desperation to be rejoined with their lost love, women do not recognize the serpent and become
        convinced that their lover has returned.

        The fiery serpent lacks the ability to hear and speak properly. It is told that those who are visited by the
        serpent experience weight loss, exhibit signs of insanity and eventually commit suicide.</p>

    <p>According to Eastern Ukrainian legends, whilst traveling, the fiery serpent throws beautiful gifts to grieving
        women and villagers, including beads, rings and handkerchiefs.

        The serpent is often represented in Slavic folk tales as entering a person's house through the chimney. The
        serpent may bring gifts of gold - but those gifts turn to horse manure at sunrise. In addition, victims of the
        serpent often experience hallucinations, including visions of supernatural torment, such as suckling on breasts
        which excrete blood rather than milk. The fiery serpent has no spinal cord and cannot correctly pronounce
        certain words. For example, instead of "Jesus Christ," the serpent may say "Sus Christ", or "Chudoroditsa," in
        place of "Bogoroditsa" (mother of God), the woman who gave birth to a miracle.

        If a child is born out of a relationship with the serpent, then that child is believed to be born with black
        skin, with hooves instead of feet, eyes without eyelids and a cold body. Such a child is fated to live a very
        short life.</p>
