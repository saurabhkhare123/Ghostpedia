    <h1>Baba yaga</h1>
    <center><img src="img/31.jpeg" alt="" class="img1"></center>
    <p>Baba Yaga is the most popular and complex character in Russian folktales and traces its origins to the ancient
        Slavic goddess who was the link between life and death, or our world and the underworld. There are many versions
        of the origins of her name, including one that links Yaga to the verb "yagatj" meaning "to be cross, to tell
        someone off," and others that connect the name Yaga to several languages with meanings such as "snake-like,"
        "ancestral," and "forest-dweller." Whatever the origin of the name, it has come to be associated with a
        crone-like character who sometimes catches and sacrifices children and is unpredictable in her behavior.

        However, this association is far from the original meaning bestowed on Baba Yaga, which was of nature,
        motherhood, and the underworld. In fact, Baba Yaga was the most beloved character in Russian folklore and
        represented the matriarchal society where it originated. Her unpredictable nature was a reflection of the
        people's relationship with the Earth when the weather could affect crops and harvest. Her blood-thirstiness
        comes from the sacrificial rituals of the ancient Slavs, and the nastiness attributed to Baba Yaga is due to the
        way the clergy liked to portray her in order to suppress pagan Slavic values that remained popular with the
        common people despite Christianity being an official religion.

        You will come across Baba Yaga in most Russian folktales. She lives in a forest—a symbol of the crossing from
        life to death in Slavic lore—in a hut that rests on two chicken legs. Yaga likes to catch travelers and make
        them do "the kitchen work," but she also welcomes travelers with food and drink, and if they answer her riddles
        correctly or display humble behavior, Yaga can become their biggest helper.</p>
