    <h1>Cyclops</h1>

    <p>In Greek mythology and later Roman mythology, the Cyclopes (/saɪˈkloʊpiːz/ sy-KLOH-peez; Greek: Κύκλωπες,
        Kýklōpes, "Circle-eyes" or "Round-eyes"; singular Cyclops /ˈsaɪklɒps/ SY-klops; Κύκλωψ, Kýklōps) are giant
        one-eyed creatures. Three groups of Cyclopes can be distinguished. In Hesiod's Theogony, they are the
        brothers Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, who provided Zeus with his weapon the thunderbolt. In Homer's Odyssey,
        they are an uncivilized group of shepherds, the brethren of Polyphemus encountered by Odysseus. Cyclopes were
        also famous as the builders of the Cyclopean walls of Mycenae and Tiryns.

        The fifth-century BC playwright Euripides wrote a satyr play entitled Cyclops, about Odysseus' encounter with
        Polyphemus. Mentions of the Hesiodic and the wall-builder Cyclopes also figure in his plays. The third-century
        BC poet Callimachus makes the Hesiodic Cyclopes the assistants of smith-god Hephaestus. So does Virgil in his
        Latin epic Aeneid, where he seems to equate the Hesiodic and Homeric Cyclopes.

        From at least the fifth-century BC, Cyclopes have been associated with the island of Sicily and the volcanic
        Aeolian Islands.</p>

    <p>Three groups of Cyclopes can be distinguished: the Hesiodic, the Homeric and the wall-builders. In Hesiod's
        Theogony, the Cyclopes are the three brothers: Brontes, Steropes, and Arges, sons of Uranus and Gaia, who made
        for Zeus his characteristic weapon, the thunderbolt. In Homer's Odyssey, the Cyclopes are an uncivilized group
        of shepherds, one of whom, Polyphemus, the son of Poseidon, is encountered by Odysseus. Cyclopes were also said
        to have been the builders of the Cyclopean walls of Mycenae and Tiryns. A scholiast, quoting the
        fifth-century BC historian Hellanicus, tells us that, in addition to the Hesiodic Cyclopes (whom the scholiast
        describes as "the gods themselves"), and the Homeric Cyclopes, there was a third group of Cyclopes: the builders
        of the walls of Mycenae.</p>
