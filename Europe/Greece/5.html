    <h1>Chimera</h1>
    <img src="img/52.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>The Chimera (/kɪˈmɪərə/ or /kaɪˈmɪərə/, also Chimaera (Chimæra); Greek: Χίμαιρα, Chímaira "she-goat"), according
        to Greek mythology, was a monstrous fire-breathing hybrid creature of Lycia in Asia Minor, composed of the
        parts of more than one animal. It is usually depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat protruding from its
        back, and a tail that might end with a snake's head. It was one of the offspring of Typhon and Echidna and a
        sibling of such monsters as Cerberus and the Lernaean Hydra.

        The term "chimera" has come to describe any mythical or fictional creature with parts taken from various
        animals, to describe anything composed of very disparate parts, or perceived as wildly imaginative, implausible,
        or dazzling.</p>
    <img src="img/52.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>The Chimera was a ferocious, fire breathing monstrosity that possessed the body and head of a lion with the head
        of a goat protruding from it’s back and a snake for a tail. The brief description of the Chimera in the text of
        The Iliad is the earliest surviving record of the creature. The Chimera is traditionally considered to have been
        a female, and was said to have given birth to the Sphinx and the Nemean lion. The monster was feared and
        believed to have been an omen for storms, shipwrecks and other natural disasters.
        ChimeraThe Chimera is best known for its role in the legend of Bellerophon. A hero born to the city of Corinth,
        Bellerophon would be ordered by king Lobates of Lycia to slay the monster in order to atone for his past sins.
        Bellerophon, knowing he would need assistance for such a task, prayed and then slept in the temple of Athena.
        Upon waking he saw the goddess before him, leading the mythical horse Pegasus, who possessed the ability of
        flight.
        With Pegasus saddled, Bellerophon flew to the lair of the Chimera in Lycia. Knowing that the creature was
        ferocious and would not easily be defeated, Bellerophon devised a plan. He attached a large chunk of lead to the
        end of his spear. Riding Pegasus, he flew towards the monster. Just as the Chimera opened it’s mouth to scorch
        the hero with fire, Bellerophon drove the lead into the creatures mouth. The fiery breath of the Chimera melted
        the lead and caused the creature to suffocate and die.</p>
