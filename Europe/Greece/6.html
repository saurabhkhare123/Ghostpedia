    <h1>The Medusa</h1>
    <img src="img/medusa.jpg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>A monstrous creature with the ability to turn to stone any person who gazed upon her face, Medusa remains a
        popular monster of ancient mythology. Interpretations of Medusa differ. Somemedusa accounts describe how Medusa
        was born to the archaic marine deity, Ceto. In this version of the tale, Medusa is born with a hideous face and
        a serpents tail where her legs should be. In Ovid’s Metamorphoses, Medusa was told to have once been a beautiful
        maiden who was transformed into a hideous monster after being raped in the temple of Athena by the sea god
        Poseidon. The one aspect of Medusa that remains consistent through various legends his her hair, which was said
        to have been composed of writhing, venomous snakes.
        Medusa is confronted by the hero Perseus, who was bade by his stepfather to retrieve the head of the monster.
        Using a mirrored shield that was given to him by Athena, Perseus viewed Medusa’s reflection so as not to look
        directly at the monster. Perseus slays Medusa and chops off her head. From the neck of the dying Gorgon, sprang
        the winged horse Pegasus. Perseus would use the head of Medusa as a weapon against enemies; until he eventually
        presented it to Athena who attached it to the front of her shield.</p>
