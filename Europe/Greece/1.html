    <h1>Typhon</h1>
    <img src="img/Typhon.jpg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>yphon was known as the “Father of All Monsters.” He was birthed from Gaia (the earth) and Tartarus (the depths of
        hell). He was said to have been the most ferocious creature ever to roam the earth. Typhon was massive. It was
        said that when he stood upright, his head brushed against the stars. The lower half of his body consisted of two
        coiled viper tails that constantly were hissing. Instead of fingers, several dragon heads erupted from his
        hands. He was said to have wings that, when spread, could blot out the sun. Fire flashed from his eyes, striking
        fear into the heart of any living creature, even the might Olympians.</p>
    <p>Typhon is described in Hesiod’s The Theogony…</p>
    <img src="img/Typhon.jpg" alt="" class="img2">
    <h3>“The hands and arms of him are mighty, and have work in them, and the feet of the powerful god were tireless,
        and up from his shoulders there grew a hundred snake heads, those of a dreaded drakon, and the heads licked with
        dark tongues, and from the eyes on the inhuman heads fire glittered from under the eyelids.” -Hesiod, The
        Theogony</h3>
    <p>Typhon was so mighty, that the only conceivable opponent to defy him was Zeus himself. While the other Olympians
        ran in fear, Zeus stood firm against the monstrous being. A great battle Typhon and Zeusensued that caused
        countless earthquakes and tsunamis. The war between Typhon and Zeus was so mighty that it threatened to break
        the planet in two.
        Eventually Zeus would triumph over Typhon. By casting one hundred well aimed thunderbolts to the head of the
        monster, Typhon was cast down into the pits of Tartarus where he was sealed away for all time. However, the rage
        of this monster could not be contained. While he was trapped beneath the earth, he occasionally would experience
        fits of anger . His furry would manifest in the form of volcanic eruptions, and in this way Typhon continues to
        terrorize humanity from his earthly prison.</p>
