    <h1>Brownie</h1>
    <img src="img/1.jpg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>A brownie or broonie (Scots), also known as a brùnaidh or gruagach (Scottish Gaelic), is a household spirit
        from Scottish folklore that is said to come out at night while the owners of the house are asleep and perform
        various chores and farming tasks. The human owners of the house must leave a bowl of milk or cream or some other
        offering for the brownie, usually by the hearth. Brownies are described as easily offended and will leave their
        homes forever if they feel they have been insulted or in any way taken advantage of. Brownies are
        characteristically mischievous and are often said to punish or pull pranks on lazy servants. If angered, they
        are sometimes said to turn malicious, like boggarts.

        Brownies originated as domestic tutelary spirits, very similar to the Lares of ancient Roman tradition.
        Descriptions of brownies vary regionally, but they are usually described as ugly, brown-skinned, and covered in
        hair. In the oldest stories, they are usually human-sized or larger. In more recent times, they have come to be
        seen as small and wizened. They are often capable of turning invisible and they sometimes appear in the shapes
        of animals. They are always either naked or dressed in rags. If a person attempts to present a brownie with
        clothing or if a person attempts to baptize him, he will leave forever.

        Although the name brownie originated as a dialectal word used only in the UK, it has since become the standard
        term for all such creatures throughout the UK and Ireland. Regional variants in England and Scotland include
        hobs, silkies, and ùruisgs. Variants outside England and Scotland are the Welsh Bwbach and the Manx Fenodyree.
        Brownies have also appeared outside of folklore, including in John Milton's poem L'Allegro. They became popular
        in works of children's literature in the late nineteenth century and continue to appear in works of modern
        fantasy. The Brownies in the Girl Guides are named after a short story by Juliana Horatia Ewing based on brownie
        folklore.</p>

    <p>Brownies originated as domestic tutelary spirits, very similar to the Lares of ancient Roman tradition, who were
        envisioned as the protective spirits of deceased ancestors. Brownies and Lares are both regarded as
        solitary and devoted to serving the members of the house. Both are said to be hairy and dress in rag and
        both are said to demand offerings of food or dairy. Like Lares, brownies were associated with the dea
        and a brownie is sometimes described as the ghost of a deceased servant who once worked in the home The
        Cauld Lad of Hilton, for instance, was reputed to be the ghost of a stable boy who was murdered by one of the
        Lords of Hilton Castle in a fit of passion. Those who saw him described him as a naked boy. He was said to
        clean up anything that was untidy and make messes of things that were tidy. The menehunes of Hawaiian
        folklore have been compared to brownies as well, seeing they are portrayed as a race of dwarf people who carry
        out work during night time.

        The family cult of deceased ancestors in ancient times centred around the hearth which later became the
        place where offerings would be left for the brownie. The most significant difference between brownies and
        Lares is that, while Lares were permanently bound to the house in which they lived,[brownies are seen as
        more mobile, capable of leaving or moving to another house if they became dissatisfied. One story
        describes a brownie who left the house after the stingy housewife fired all the servants because the brownie was
        doing all the work and refused to return until all the servants had been re-hired.</p>
