    <h1>Kitta Grau</h1>
    <center><img src="img/3.jpg" alt="" class="img1"></center>
    <p>This story tells the tale of a very evil woman named Kitta Grau. She was such a despicable person that she knew
        the Devil when she saw him. She was essentially on first name terms with him and was such a nasty person that
        even he had some fear of her. He had been trying to spread discord between a newly married couple, but had been
        failing. Kitta Grau mocked him, saying that she could easily do the deed and ensure the couple would no longer
        be so happy. The Devil encouraged her to pull off the wicked stunt, promising her a beautiful pair of shoes if
        she succeeded</p>
    <p>The wicked woman first went to talk to the wife, telling her that her husband was indeed a wonderful man, but
        that there was still evil in his heart. She claimed that she needed to shave her husband under his chin to
        remove the last of the wickedness that resided within him. The woman, thinking this could do nothing but good,
        agreed that shaving her husband while he napped was a good idea. Kitta then went to talk to the husband. She
        first praised their marriage, and the man’s wonderful wife, but told him that his wife planned to cut his
        throat.</p>
    <p>He didn’t really believe it, but couldn’t help but be a bit paranoid regardless, and so when he reclined that
        day, he only pretended to be sleeping. Carrying out her plan, his wife tried to shave him, and her husband was
        incensed, convinced that she had been trying to kill him. The two did not kill each other, but the Devil’s wish
        to sow permanent discord in their marriage was successful, and Kitta Grau earned a brand new pair of shoes.
