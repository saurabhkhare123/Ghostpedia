    <h1>Leirubakki Ghost</h1>
    <center><img src="img/5.jpg" alt="" class="img1"></center>
    <p>This tale begins with a ship that went down near the coast of Iceland. While the legend of the ghost is a
        folktale, many of the events leading up to it were real. An actual Danish ship named the Gothenborg sunk back in
        the 1700s, but luckily nearly all of the 170 occupants were safely rescued.Unfortunately, this did not mean that
        the survivors’ troubles were over. Those who had survived had no way of quickly getting back home. Their ship
        was sunk and their supplies were gone, so they were dependent on the kindness of local farmers to keep them
        alive until other arrangements could be made. Sadly, there simply was not enough food to go around for everyone,
        and some people ended up starving to death, most notably the ship’s cook.</p>
    <p>Nearly a century later, two men accidentally brought the cook back from his eternal slumber. The specter simply
        came out of the ground, and the two terrified men quickly left the graveyard to escape from the ghost.
        Unfortunately, the ghost followed one of them from the graveyard and began haunting him until the day of his
        death. Even when the man moved to Leirubakki, it would not leave him or his family alone, and thus it became
        known as the Leirubakki ghost.He was not known to be particularly dangerous, but stalked the family wherever
        they went to frighten them and others around them. Some of the legends claim that he tore the roof off a barn
        once, and he was well-known for spooking horses. Some people say that his ghost still walks the Earth in
        Iceland, looking for people to frighten, taking out his tragic death on innocent Icelanders.</p>
