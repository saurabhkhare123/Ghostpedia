    <h1>The Devil And The Bailiff
        Norway</h1>
    <center><img src="img/4.jpg" alt="" class="img1"></center>
    <p>This tale begins with a bailiff who was infamous among the rest of the townsfolk for swindling people.
        Essentially nobody liked the man, and they constantly cursed his name, asking for the Devil to take him to hell
        so they could be done with him forever. Eventually, the Devil decided it was time to claim the man’s soul as his
        own and confronted the wicked bailiff, telling him that everyone wanted the Devil to take him away, and that he
        was clearly a very evil man.</p>
    <p>The bailiff, being a swindler, immediately set about trying to con the Devil into a deal that would get him out
        of the trouble he was in. He felt that if the Devil were going to do what people asked, then he should do what
        the bailiff asked as well. The Devil likes making deals with mortals for his own amusement, so he agreed to
        spend some time with the bailiff, and if someone they came across sincerely asked for someone to be taken by the
        Devil, then the Devil would take that person instead of the evil swindler.</p>
    <p>First, they came upon a woman whose pig knocked over the butter she was churning. She cursed the pig to the
        Devil, and the bailiff believed he had won, but the Devil told him that the woman didn’t truly want her pig
        gone, for she had need of him, and so it was not truly sincere. Further on, they came upon a mother who was
        having trouble with her child’s behavior, and made a similar comment that she wished the Devil would take the
        child away. However, the bailiff still did not have his victory, because the Devil did not believe the mother
        truly wanted her child taken away.Finally, they came upon some farmers who were talking nearby, and the farmers
        saw the bailiff and the Devil together. The farmers pointed out the bailiff and cursed his name, asking for the
        Devil to take him away. True to his word, the Devil knew the farmers were being sincere, and dragged the bailiff
        down with him to the depths of hell.
