    <h1>The Sacrificial Beggar Child</h1>
    <center><img src="img/1.jpg" alt="" class="img1"></center>
    <p>The story goes that there was a town named Dalland that was suffering from a disease that was wiping out much of
        the population and causing many people to flee. The townsfolk were beside themselves with worry about how to
        stop it, until an old man from Finland came along with sage advice on how to stop the disease.He told them that
        only a sacrifice would put an end to it, and explained that they would need to bury a living thing in the
        ground. The villagers were desperate to stop the disease, so they took his advice. They began by burying a
        rooster alive in the ground, but their cruel act failed to produce any results, so they upped the ante by
        burying an entire goat alive. Unfortunately, this also failed.</p>
    <p>Feeling there were no other options left, they decided that the only sacrifice worthy enough to end the spread of
        the disease would be an actual human being. In order to accomplish this, they set their sights on an orphaned
        boy and offered him bread as bait for their trap. The unassuming child fell for their trap completely and was
        dropped in a prepared hole. The villagers immediately began shoveling dirt on top of the hapless child. The boy
        was terrified and tried to plead with them to stop burying him alive, but they continued on with their work
        without mercy.Before long, the job was done and the child was simply left to die, in the hopes he would end the
        spread of the deadly disease. Some villagers claimed that they could hear his cries from under the ground, even
        after his death, decrying the cruel act that had been done to him</p>
