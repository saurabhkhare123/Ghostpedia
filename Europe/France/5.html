    <h1>Guivre</h1>
    <img src="img/51.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>A guivre is a mythical creature similar to a dragon. In legend they were portrayed as serpentine creatures who
        possessed venomous breath and prowled the countryside of Medieval France.[1] The words "guivre" (wurm, wyvern
        [which is derived from it], or serpent) and "givre" are spelling variations of the more common word "vouivre".
        Vouivre, in Franc-Comtois, is the equivalent of the old French word "guivre." All these forms are derived
        ultimately from Latin vÄ«pera, as is English viper.</p>
    <img src="img/52.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>Guivres were said to possess a long, serpentine body and a dragon's head. The guivre had horns in its forehead in
        some accounts, as well. Locally in France it was known as an extremely aggressive creature that would sometimes
        attack without being provoked.[4] They were afraid of naked humans, and when saw them, blushed and looked away.
        Documentation points to their residence as being in small bodies of water like pools and lakes, forests, and any
        damp place.also found in Europe.</p>
    <p>Samson of Dol was present at an encounter between a small dragon-like creature (known as "La Guivre") and a
        priest. Samson had come to visit Saint Suliao with an entourage of followers. Suliao was impoverished but sought
        to provide a meal as best as possible for the group. One priest, uneasy with the low quality of food, took a
        bread roll and hid it under his robe. Almost instantaneously he started convulsing and Suliao pulled apart his
        bosom, seeing what the man had done. He admonished the priest and removed a hideous serpentine creature from the
        robe. There he exorcised it and then compelled another man to throw it from the roof of a building in Garot.</p>
