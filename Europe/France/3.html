    <h1>Loups garous</h1>
    <img src="img/21.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>A loup garou is a mythical creature in French, Canadian and American folklores which is believed to come into
        existence as a result of a curse. It is basically the same thing with a rougarou/rugaru/roux-ga-roux/rugaroo.

        The word “loup-garou” is derived from French. In French language, the word loup means wolf while garoul means a
        man who can turn into a wolf – basically werewolf in English.</p>
    <p>The belief in loup garous is especially strong among French Canadians, Cajun people and the people of Louisiana.

        According to a Cajun legend, loup garous wander around in forests and swamps of Greater New Orleans and
        Acadiana. These creatures have a man’s body and a wolf’s head very similar to the legends regarding
        werewolves/lycanthropes </p>
    <img src="img/22.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>There are different beliefs in different folklores regarding the loup garou curse.

        One of these beliefs related to French Catholics suggests that a person will transform into a loup
        garou/rougarou if he breaks the rules of Lent for 7 consecutive years.

        According to another belief, the transformation of a human being into a loup garou results from a spell. A
        person put under the loup garou curse will remain in that form for 101 days and the curse will be passed onto
        another human being when the loup garou draws that person’s blood.</p>
<p>Another myth suggests that only a witch can put a loup garou curse on a person either by becoming a wolf herself or simply cursing people with lycanthropy.

    An expert on Cajun folklore, Professor Barry Jean Ancelet of the University of Louisiana wrote in an article that loup garous were a result of a curse but sometimes a person voluntarily chose to become one.
    
    Some stories suggest that, by means of therianthropy – the ability of metamorphosing into animals, a person can transform into a loup garou/rougarou.
    
    The origin of the myth regarding loup garous dates back to medieval France. The myth changed with time and in the 16th century people started to believe the loup garou curse was genetic and not something that could be transferred from one person to another.
    
    This myth also involved a trigger for the curse. According to the belief, some event in this person’s life triggered his condition (although there is no specific information regarding the kind of event in question since this is an oral tradition passed on from generation to generation ).
    
    His body enlarged and he got a craving for raw meat. The transformation process was completed when this person took a bite of human flesh.
