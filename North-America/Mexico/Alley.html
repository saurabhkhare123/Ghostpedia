    Once there lived a priest in San Luis Potosi, however, one day he went on a trip to an unknowndestination to collect donations for the church. During his trip, he was traveling with two boyswhom he hired for labor, yet had been discreetly planning to rob the priest. When the priestreturned, he took a walk down an alley to his house where he lay in a puddle of his blood thefollowing day. It was later found that the teenage boys that the priest hired were responsible forhis death, thus, they were hung by the neck. After their death, their hands were severed and hungon the wall of the alley near the house of the priest as a lesson to the people of the town. This urban legend involves a priest who, in 1780, was supposedly murdered by two teenage boys in a small city in Mexico. The boys were hanged for the crime and their hands were cut off. Itâ€™s said if you walk down the alley where the priest died during the month of November, you can see a pair of ghostly hands floating above you.
