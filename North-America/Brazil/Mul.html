    <h1>Mulher de Branco</h1>
    <img src="img/mul1.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Like most countries, Brazil has its fair share of urban legends, some of them terrifying. Take the legend of the
        loira do banheiro (the bathroom blonde), for instance. This legend tells the tale of a beautiful blonde girl who
        killed herself (or was killed) in a bathroom. Her soul is trapped there, and she must spend the rest of eternity
        scaring the crap out of people who show up to do their business.

        There are other loira legends as well, including one that involves a blonde on the street who tricks men into
        giving her a lift, then tries to murder them. In addition, as with cultures around the world, there are many
        loosely related accounts of ghostly women dressed in white, collectively known as White Ladies, most of whom
        were violently killed. Some died in childbirth; others were murdered in so-called honor killings. All of them
        hang around the land of the living to haunt the places where they met their ugly ends, and sometimes to seduce
        men and lead them to their deaths.</p>
    <img src="img/Mul2.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>One of the more memorable White Lady tales in Brazil is that of the cobbler’s daughter, a beautiful girl who was given in marriage to a wealthy plantation owner. One day, the plantation owner became angry with her for showing kindness to a slave. The girl’s cruel husband murdered the slave and forced her to either eat the dead man’s flesh or starve to death. The cobbler’s daughter opted for starvation and became a White Lady when she died.
