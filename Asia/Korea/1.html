    <h1>The Virgin Ghost</h1>
    <img src="img/11.jpg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Cheonyeo Gwishin (처녀 귀신) is a Korean ghost in the form of a long haired woman in white. In Korean legend, young
        women who die in a virgin will be ashamed of being a virgin. Therefore, the appearance of a ghost of a woman
        will appear around her relatives and friends. This ghost is described as having long hair, pale white face, and
        bleeding from his mouth. Cheonyeo Gwishin also wears a white shirt (Korean traditional dress called Hanbok).</p>
    <img src="img/12.jpg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>Because the mission of his life to get married is not fulfilled, it is impossible for him to cross into the world
        of spirits. The only way to eliminate the ghostly appearance of Cheohyeo Gwishin is to perform a ritual of
        exorcism or to marry a virgin ghost (Cheonyeo Gwishin) with a bachelor ghost (Mongdal Gwishin).
