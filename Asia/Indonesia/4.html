    <h1>Wewe Gombel</h1>
    <img src="img/41.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Wewe Gombel is a female supernatural being or ghost in Javanese mythology. It is said that she kidnaps children.

        This myth is taught to encourage children to be cautious and to stay at home at night. Traditionally, the Wewe
        Gombel is represented as a woman with long, hanging breast. Modern representations include vampire-like fangs.
        This is a popular spirit that also appears in comics</p>
    <img src="img/42.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>The ghost was named Wewe Gombel because it is related to an event that, according to ancient folklore, happened
        in Bukit Gombel, Semarang, where long ago a married couple lived. They had been married for years, but as time
        went by the husband realized that his wife was barren and stopped loving her.
        The husband became wayward, neglecting his wife and leaving her alone for long periods of time, so that she
        lived in sorrow. One day she followed him and caught him in a sexual relationship with another woman. Hurt by
        her husband's betrayal she became furious and killed him. Faced with the crime, angry neighbors gathered in a
        mob and chased her from the village. Despairing at the ostracization and continual harassment, she committed
        suicide.

        After death her vengeful spirit became Wewe Gombel. Sundanese folklore says that she dwells in the crown of the
        Arenga pinnata palm, where she has her nest and keeps the children she catches. She does not harm them and once
        they are under her clutches they are not afraid of her.

        Local traditions say that the children she abducts have been mistreated or neglected by their parents. She
        treats the children lovingly as a grandmother would, taking care of them and protecting them until their parents
        repent, at which point she returns them.

        Wewe Gombel has affinities with the ghost known as Hantu Kopek in Malay folklore.</p>
