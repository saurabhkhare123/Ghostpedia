    <h1>Sweet Girl </h1>
  <center> <img src="img/5.jpg" alt="" class="img1"></center>
    <p>This legend revolves around the ghost of Maryam, a girl that is said to haunt Ancol Bridge in Jakarta, Indonesia.
        The locals believe that her ghostly presence in Ancol Bridge is the reason behind the many traffic accidents in
        the area.
        The sad story of Maryam has its roots from a tragic incident that was said to have happened in the early 1800â€™s.
        The story goes that Maryam was a servant of a wealthy old merchant. When she was sixteen, her beauty captivated
        the wealthy merchant so much that he wanted to have her as a concubine. Such a fate was unthinkable for the
        young maid, thus she decided to run away instead.</p>
   
    <p>While Maryam was wandering around, looking for a new place to stay, another rich old guy took notice of her beauty and made some advances, which Maryam rejected. Angered by her rejection, he went after her with some of his thugs. Poor Maryam was raped and killed by her suitor, who dumped her body in a nearby rice field.

        There have since been many reported sightings of a ghostly woman near Ancol Bridge, whose presence is said to cause traffic accidents to any male motorists passing by.
