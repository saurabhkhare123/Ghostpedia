    <h1>Nishi Dak </h1>
    <img src="img/11.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Almost everywhere in the world and in most parts of India, the supernatural is usually divided into four broad
        categories of spirits — those that don’t harm or good spirits, evil spirits or spirits that harm, prets or
        spirits of our ancestors who can either help or harm, and spirits that neither help nor harm and are content to
        live their spirit existence. The Nishi Dak belongs to the second category which is also the most dangerous
        category. What is a Nishi Dak ? Nishi means night or dark, dak or daak means call. The Nishi Dak is a spirit
        that calls out to one at night or in the dark in a familiar voice. It is a very dangerous spirit, once fairly
        commonly encountered in Bengal — where it still known as the Nishir Daak or Call of the Night Spirit, Bihar and
        Jharkhand where it is known as the Nishi.
        How does a Nishi operate ? The Nishi calls out to its victim at night in the voice of a person known to the
        victim, appears as a form which the victim can’t fully see because it is always in the distance, or appears in
        the form of the known person whose voice it has used, and keeps beckoning the intended victim to follow it. It
        walks very fast and at a distance ahead of the victim and usually leads the way to a deserted area where it
        reveals its true form to the helpless victim, and then almost invariably kills the victim. The killing takes
        place through different means.</p>
    
    <p>The important thing about the Nishi is that it cannot call out more than twice. That is why, just like the
        Chalawa which can also assume different forms and voices but can be identified because it cannot keep its eyes
        focused, the Nishi can be identified if it calls out a person’s name no more than two times and that too only at
        night.

        Even today, many people in areas frequented by the Nishi — yes, such areas still exist ! — are aware that they
        must not respond unless even a known voice doesn’t call out three — or to be on the absolutely safe side, four
        times. However, Nishis’ can otherwise converse with the victim in a voice familiar to the victim. It is only
        rarely that Nishis’ kill a person very close to one’s home. Also, it usually picks only one victim at night and
        that too on dark moon nights. It is very seldom that anybody other than the victim can even see the hazy form of
        a Nishi.</p>
    <img src="img/12.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>It is believed that the Nishis’ are spirits of people who have not had a respectful or a complete release or
        pind-daan at the time of transition from earth to the astral planes. A tea vendor close to my house hails from
        Bihar and he tells me that in and around his village there is a Nishi who is always on the prowl. And they know
        the Nishi is the soul of a villager who died many generations ago but his family did not complete the rituals at
        Pret Pahar —Mountain of Spirits — in Gaya.


        At first the soul which could not get mukti or release from earthly bonds haunted the family as a pret and when
        they still didn’t do anything, turned into a Nishi, and one by one, lured all the family members to their death.
        To this day, nobody, according to the tea vendor, goes out at night if called. And these days, he says, a
        Nishi’s call can even come on a mobile — there has been one such instance where a person was killed after
        responding to a call on his mobile to come outside. The way and speed with which he was killed was the work of a
        Nishi says the tea vendor.

        People who are killed in road accidents, especially on a deserted road at night are also believed very often to
        have been killed by Nishis’ who need to kill to survive. And so, it is said, are those who die unnatural,
        unexplained deaths at night.</p>
