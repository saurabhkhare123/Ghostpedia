    <h1>Fatal fare</h1>
  <center><img src="img/1.jpg" alt="" class="img1"></center>  
    <p>Ichiro had been driving cabs in Japan for over 40 years. He had seen many strange things in his many years of
        driving. He had picked up hundreds of drunks, weirdoes, and perverts. But his final fare was by far his
        strangest.

        He was driving alone one night when he seemed to see someone suddenly appear as if out of nowhere, hailing a
        cab. He stopped and the passenger door opened automatically. The man was dressed in all black, with a long coat
        and hood that shadowed his face.

        “Where would you like to go?” Ichiro asked. The mysterious man answered with an address that Ichiro had never
        heard of before. When he mentioned this to the passenger, the mysterious man answered, “I’ll give you
        directions.”

        As they drove the man guided Ichiro down twisted, and strange streets. He then guided him far out of the city.
        Whenever Ichiro mentioned this, the stranger assured him that they would be there soon.

        As they drove down a dark barely paved road, Ichiro turned to ask the passenger for more directions, but no one
        was there. Shocked, he continued to look frantically for the passenger. But it was as if he were never there.
    </p>
   
    <p>When he turned back around to check the road he was driving on, he saw just meters in front of him the precipice of a cliff. Ichiro slammed on the breaks. But it was too little too late. The last thing Ichiro saw were the sharp rocks of the bottom of the cliff flying up to hit him.
