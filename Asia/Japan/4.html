    <h1>Hanako-san</h1>
    <img src="img/41.jpeg" alt="" class="img1">
    <p>Hanako-san, or Toire no Hanako-san (トイレのはなこさん, "Hanako of the Toilet"), is a Japanese urban legend about the
        spirit of a young girl named Hanako-san who haunts school bathrooms. Like many urban legends, the details of the
        origins of the legend vary depending on the account. Legends about Hanako-san have achieved some popularity in
        old Japanese schools where children may challenge classmates to try to summon Hanako-san the spirit</p>
    <p>According to legend, Hanako-san is the spirit of a young girl who haunts school bathrooms, and can be described
        as a yōkai or a yūrei.The details of her physical appearance vary across different sources, but she is
        commonly described as having a bobbed haircut and as wearing a red skirt or dress. The details of
        Hanako-san's origins also vary depending on the account; in some versions, Hanako-san was a child who was
        murdered by a stranger or an abusive parent in a school bathroom; in other versions, she was a girl who
        committed suicide in a school bathroom; in still other versions, she was a child who lived during World War
        II, and who was killed in an air raid while hiding in a school bathroom during a game of hide-and-seek.</p>
    <img src="img/42.jpeg" alt="" class="img2">
    <p>To summon Hanako-san, it is often said that individuals must enter a girls' bathroom (usually on the third floor
        of a school), knock three times on the third stall, and ask if Hanako-san is present. If Hanako-san is
        there, she will reply with some variation of "Yes, I am." Depending on the story, the individual may then
        witness the appearance of a bloody or ghostly hand; the hand, or Hanako-san herself, may pull the
        individual into the toilet, which may lead to Hell; or the individual may be eaten by a three-headed
        lizard.

        
        Author and folklorist Matthew Meyer has described the legend of Hanako-san as dating back to the 1950s.
        Michael Dylan Foster, author of The Book of Yōkai: Mysterious Creatures of Japanese Folklore, has stated that
        Hanako-san "is well known because it is essentially an 'urban legend' associated with schools all over Japan.
        Since the 1990s, it has also been used in movies, so it became part of popular culture ... not just orally
        transmitted or local folklore". In 2014, an article published by NPR described Hanako-san as having "become a
        fixture of Japanese urban folklore over the last 70 years".</p>
