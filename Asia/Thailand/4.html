    <h1>Phra Luang Phor Tuad</h1>

    <p>Luang Pu Thuat (Thai: หลวงปู่ทวด), also known as Luang Pu Thuad, Luang Por Tuad, Luang Phu Tuad, and various
        other spellings. Luang Pu Thuat was born in 1582 (2125 BE) and died 1682 (2225 BE) in Ayer Kala, Lenggong,
        Perak, Malaysia. He is a revered Buddhist monk who lived in Siam. He is said to have performed miracles.
    </p>
    <p>Luang Pu Thuat is mentioned in the early regional histories of southern Thailand, but his life is mainly
        preserved in oral traditions. Stories of the famous monk were passed on by word of mouth for centuries. As a
        result, it is a mixture of Buddhist elements: early signs, alleged magic, travel, study, meditation and eventual
        “sainthood.”

        His movements throughout the southern Thai peninsula constitute a path of pilgrimage for many of his
        followers.

        Luang Pu Thuat has also been said to have saved countless lives of people be it the battlefield, car accidents,
        armed robbery or more with his sacred amulets.</p>

    <p>Many people in Thailand, Singapore and Malaysia believe that amulets depicting Luang Pu Thuat hold great
        protective powers granting safety in times of distress, especially saving the lives of believers from seemingly
        fatal automobile accidents. Phra Archan Tim Dharmataro, abbot of Wat Chang Hai is the pioneer creator of Phra
        Luang Phor Thuad amulets.[citation needed]

        Older, sacred amulets of Pu Thuat are considered priceless and very powerful.

        The first batch of Laung Pu Thuat amulets was made in 2497 BE (1954). It consisted entirely of amulets made from
        herbs (nua wan). This is the most famous batch of Laung Pu Thuat amulets because it was the first batch; it is
        referred to as the 2497 batch. All amulets were made of herbs and powder. Subsequently, more amulets were made
        and coin (rian) variations were added (2500, 2504 etc.). The next most famous batch of amulets was produced in
        2505 BE. This batch is famous for the new type of Laung Pu Thuat amulet which was cast in the shape of a
        traditional iron. This type of amulet is called Lang Taolit. It is famous and highly sought after as it is the
        first time Lang Taolit amulets were made. There are two types of Lang Taolit - (1) with no words behind (lang
        taolit)  with words behind (lang taolit nang suer). *Nang Suer means book in Thai.

        There are various moulds for producing the lang taolit (e.g. A, B, and C - with C being the lowest quality with
        features that were blurred). This is because the mould loses its shape and features as more amulets were made
        out of them.</p>
