# Ghostpedia
Every country has its own urban legends about the creatures that dwells and thrive
in the dark. While some stories, like Bigfoot, have entered mainstream pop culture,
others have stayed local like Jinn Umm Al Duwais of the United Arab
Emirates(UAE).
As the title of the project suggests, Ghostpedia will be all about urban legends and
will provide its viewers with brief but reliable information about various ghostly
creatures in an interesting manner. The information will be arranged country wise
so that the viewer can easily get to the information they are searching for without
wasting much of their time. It will have a spooky look to keep the viewer hooked
to the website.
I've used HTML ,css ,Javascript ,jquery and bootstrap to develop this project.
All animation is done with the help of jquery and css.
Responsiveness of buttons was done by Jquery.
