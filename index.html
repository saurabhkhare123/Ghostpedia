                The most common of all ghosts spotted is usually of a deceased person, someone you know, a family member
                or perhaps even a historical figure. These ghosts can be friendly or not – but often show themselves to
                others in a variety of ways. They can become visible; they can speak or make noises, touch you or even
                emit an odor like perfume or cigar smoke, etc, to let you know they are there. Experts say that this
                type of ghost retains its former personality of when they were alive and can feel emotions. And often,
                they are visiting you to comfort you or let you know something important. So if you happen to see a lost
                loved one, chances are they are there because they feel you want or need to see them.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Ever seen a mist or fog that almost looks like it’s swirling? If so, you
                may be witnessing what paranormal investigators deem as an ecto-mist or ghostly mist. This vaporous
                cloud usually appears several feet off the ground and can move swiftly or simply stay still – almost
                likes it’s orbiting. These ghostly encounters have been captured on many videos and in photographs and
                can be white, gray or even black. Although they can simply appear this way, linger then move away
                quickly, sometimes ectoplasms appear before becoming a full-bodied apparition. Many people have
                witnessed them outdoors, in graveyards, battlefields and historical sites.</p>

            <p class="sectiontag text-big">The Poltergeist</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Perhaps one of the most popular terms most of us have heard when it
                comes to ghosts, the word poltergeist actually means “noisy ghost” because it is said to have the
                ability to move or knock things over, make noise and manipulate the physical environment. While many of
                us had heard the term before, a poltergeist is actually one of the rarest forms of hauntings and to
                many, the most terrifying. Loud knocking sounds, lights turning on and off, doors slamming, even fires
                breaking out mysteriously have all been attributed to this type of a spiritual disturbance. Another
                frightening aspect of the poltergeist is that the event usually starts out slowly and mildly, then
                begins to intensify. And while many times poltergeist activity is harmless and ends quickly, they have
                been known to actually become dangerous. Some experts explain it as a mass form of energy that a living
                person is controlling unknowingly. Whatever the case may be, poltergeists have caught the attention of
                paranormal enthusiasts and experts, scientists and many others who are just plain curious.</p>
